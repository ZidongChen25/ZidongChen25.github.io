Zidong is currently pursuing an MRes in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Imperial College London, with a focus on Robotic Learning. Prior to this, he earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Sheffield, graduating with high first-class honours â€” equivalent to a 4.0/4.0 on the US scale. My undergraduate experience was profiled by the University of Sheffield. You can read the article [here](https://sheffield.ac.uk/mps/undergraduate/maths-student-profiles/zidong-chen).


## News
* **2025-10**: I am very excited to join the [Safe Whole-body Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://swirl.uk/) lead by [Dr. Stephen James](https://stepjam.github.io/) at Imperial College London, my research direction will focus on VLA, Mobile Manipulation and 3DGS.

* **2025-09**: I finished my internship at Manchester Metropolitan University. Check out my first paper as first-author: [Dense-Jump Flow Matching with Non-Uniform Time Scheduling for Robotic
Policies: Mitigating Multi-Step Inference Degradation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13574). It was a wonderful experience working with Zhihao Guo and Dr. Peng Wang.
